## Game design overview

### Expected Engagement and Aesthetic
_Five Night Finale_ immerses players in a visually striking world that draws heavily from 1980s aesthetics, blending retro-futurism, realism, and bizarre comedic elements. This unique combination creates an atmosphere that is simultaneously nostalgic and surreal, engaging players through vibrant visuals and an unconventional tone. The game explores its aesthetic primarily through environmental storytelling, relying on detailed backdrops and interactive elements to convey its narrative. Direct storytelling is kept to a minimum, allowing players to interpret the world through subtle visual cues. The single level is rooted in the high-energy ambiance of a casino merged with the chaos of a TV studio, providing a dynamic and memorable setting that enhances the game’s identity.

### Gameplay Mechanics 
Characters have two primary attacks: a standard move and a more powerful special attack. In addition, players can jump, altering the nature of their attacks when airborne to introduce versatility and strategy. The gameplay rewards precision and timing with a robust combo system, where combining attacks triggers extra effects. This mechanic is shared by both the player and enemies, creating an engaging push-and-pull dynamic during combat. Combos also have a stunning effect—players are temporarily immobilized when stunned, while enemies may fall to the floor, adding a layer of tactical decision-making to encounters.
The game supports cooperative multiplayer for two players, enhancing replayability and adding a social element to the experience. Both keyboard and controller input are fully supported. Breakable objects are scattered throughout the level, providing small health boosts when destroyed, adding a layer of resource management to the game’s fast-paced combat.

### Game World Description 
The entirety of _Five Night Finale_ takes place within a single, intricately designed level inspired by the glitzy atmosphere of a casino fused with the frenetic energy of a TV studio. Players progress through a series of interconnected rooms filled with waves of enemies. Each room allows for free movement, enabling players to strategize and adapt their approach to combat. Once all enemy waves in a room are defeated, the exit unlocks, permitting players to advance to the next area. However, progression is linear, as players are unable to backtrack to previous rooms, heightening the sense of forward momentum and urgency.

## Visual Style Guide

### Main Visual Aesthetic
The visual style of Five Night Finale embraces a deliberately imperfect pixel art aesthetic, designed to evoke a sense of 1980s nostalgia while maintaining a modern sensibility. This non-pixel-perfect approach captures the charm of retro gaming without adhering strictly to the limitations of classic hardware, resulting in a distinctive style that blends familiarity with innovation. The vibrant color palette, exaggerated character animations, and carefully designed environments amplify the surreal tone of the game, drawing players deeper into its quirky, high-stakes world.

### Character Designs
Five Night Finale offers two unique playable characters, each with a distinct combat style that caters to different gameplay preferences. The first is a dancer, whose movements are graceful and rhythmic, incorporating elements of performance into their fighting style. Their attacks feel fluid and artistic, creating a sense of elegance amidst the chaos. The second character is a kickboxer, offering a more grounded and intense combat approach with powerful, precise strikes. This character’s strength lies in their raw physicality, providing players with a no-nonsense brawler archetype.

The game’s enemies are designed to maintain a cohesive aesthetic while introducing subtle variations to keep encounters engaging. There are five main enemy archetypes, differentiated by distinct accessories and physical traits, such as facemasks or hats. These design elements not only add visual diversity but also make it easier for players to identify threats during combat.

Additionally, the game features three uniquely designed bosses, each serving as a climactic encounter before reaching a checkpoint. These bosses have distinctive visual identities and gameplay mechanics, making them memorable and challenging opponents that test the player’s mastery of the game’s systems.

### World Designs
The world of Five Night Finale unfolds entirely within the confines of a television studio, as the game’s premise revolves around a high-stakes, surreal game show. The studio is intricately decorated with a luxurious casino theme, allowing for creative yet efficient use of environmental assets. Areas such as VIP lounges, employee-only zones, and vibrant gaming floors provide a diverse range of settings that maintain the thematic consistency of the level while offering visual variety.

As the narrative unfolds and the protagonist discovers that the $50 million prize is a fabrication, the world design begins to break the fourth wall, transitioning players out of the carefully curated studio spaces and into the behind-the-scenes chaos of the TV show. The once-glamorous casino setting gives way to industrial backdrops filled with exposed equipment, scaffolding, and the machinery used to run the production. Players will now battle against the workers of the TV show, further emphasizing the unraveling of the show’s illusion and heightening the sense of betrayal and urgency.

This transition adds depth to the game’s narrative and visual storytelling, creating a striking contrast between the polished facade of the casino and the raw, utilitarian spaces hidden behind the scenes. The design draws inspiration from Persona 5’s Nae’s Palace, incorporating opulence and decadence that gives way to chaotic realism, enhancing the surrealist tone of the game.
